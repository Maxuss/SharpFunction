# SharpFunction
[![wakatime](https://wakatime.com/badge/github/Maxuss/SharpFunction.svg)](https://wakatime.com/badge/github/Maxuss/SharpFunction)

A library for creating datapacks using .NET

SharpFunction's main priority is to simplify the boring work
when making datapacks and focus on interesting parts!

## Installation
SharpFunction is available on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SharpFunction/#).
It is well documented, but if you have any questions, [create an issue](https://github.com/Maxuss/SharpFunction/issues),
or contact me on discord: Void Moment#3333

## Usage
It is recommended to have functional IDE such as Visual Studio or JetBrains Rider.

You can import SharpFunction after installing, like that:
```csharp
using SharpFunction.API;
using SharpFunction.Universal;
// ...
```

You can also [see examples](https://github.com/Maxuss/SharpFunction/tree/main/SFExample), or [simple guide](https://github.com/Maxuss/SharpFunction/wiki), or just [check full documentation](https://maxuss.github.io/SharpFunction)!

## Addons
 Addons use main library of SharpFunction, to make something more specialized and do not need special installation.
### Skyblock
It is the only current addon for SharpFunction.

It allows creating
* realistic skyblock-like items
* realistic skyblock-like gui parts
* skyblock-like entity summons
And even *whole* slayer, with custom drops, gui items etc.

## Plans for future

Current plans:
* ~~Skyblock Addon~~
* ~~Already made project loading~~
* Loot table editing
* Dimension/Worldgen creation
* ???
